### Scan receipts into Google drive folder (receipt-ocr)
- Don't use any picture correction
- Try to ensure that the picture is straight
- Use good lighting, try to flatten the receipt as much as possible
- Share folder, or do scans by myself

### Plan for processing:
- Create CSV with date, total, merchant, purchaser, lines with euro amounts, URL to original receipt
- Import the CSV into google sheets, perform basic data cleaning
- Add categories to all items based on item name
- See what you're spending the most money on!
